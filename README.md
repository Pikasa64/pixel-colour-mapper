This Python project demonstrates pixel-level color matching between two images. 
Given a source and a destination image, the script attempts to match each 
pixel in the destination with a similar color pixel from the source based 
on a user-defined tolerance.

This is just an experiment lol and is not optimized so feel free to leave your suggestions!!
